    There were a few problems we encountered as some of us had trouble using it with the school's server. Overall it did perform to our expectations.

	<h1>Was it difficult to install or configure?</h1>
	</div>
    <p style="font-size:20px">
    Installation process was very easy and simple as we just followed the instructions provided on CodeIgniters main site.

	<h1>Was it easy to create the page with it?</h1>
	</div>
    <p style="font-size:20px">
    When installing Codeigniter, there were provided files to make a starter page which made easy to work off of. There were also tutorial that helped with the learning process.

	<h1>Was the learning curve steep compared with regular HTML/CSS?</h1>
	</div>
    <p style="font-size:20px">
    The learning curve was not very steep compared to regular HTML/CSS. Since we have done some PHP in our labs, it made the learning process easier as CodeIgniter is a PHP framework.

<h1>Would you have done things differently in retrospect?</h1>
</div>
<p style="font-size:20px">
We probably wouldnâ€™t change anything except maybe to be more organized. We would change the way we planned/split up the work because we were confused on who would do what.

	<h1>Did you regret your choice of framework/CMS?</h1>
	</div>
    <p style="font-size:20px">
    For most of us, this is our first framework so we do not have any other ones to compare to. CodeIgniter was pretty simple to use so it was a good learning experience. This framework also has documentation/a large collection of libraries which helped a lot when we were making this site.
